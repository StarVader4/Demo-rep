        <h2>You are slime</h2>
        <p>You are slime is going to be an action based rpg focusing on you, a slime. You will travel through different dungeons, solving puzzles, and solving mysteries.</p>
        <p>The slime can switch between elements that do different things. To not make dungeons complicated I want to have 1-2 elements per dungeon. Except the last one of course</p>
        <p>One thing that must be known is that one character will always appear in the game with a varying role.</p>
        <p>They could be the villian, a boss, a playable character, protagonist, or just a random npc. You'll have to find them, they stand out.</p>
        <p>You play as a slime with a sword, bow, hammer, or whatever I decide to put in the game.</p>
        <p>I want the main character to be potrayed as the person playing while also being their own unique character, similair to Frisk from Undertale</p>
